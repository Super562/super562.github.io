      <p> This is my website and welcome. As you can tell, most of the colors in this are WoW-like.</p> <br>
      <p> Well, World of Warcraft has gotten addicting again so I have been starting to grind on it once more. We have the Fel flame and the void looking background. Before I stop, I would like to say thank you very much for stopping by at the early stage of the website.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>12/5/16: Changed color to properly show a contrast between the background.</li>
        <li>12/1/16: CHRISTMASS HYPE: For a small and quick christmas present, A music section has been created to give the website more content!</li>
        <li>11/28/16: Changed the Videos section to about page due to likelihood of me not using it.<br>
        Increased font size to make website easier to read and not create as much waste of space with most of the pages.</li>
