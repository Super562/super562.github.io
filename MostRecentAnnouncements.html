        <p>12/14/16: *nose bleed* <br>
        Oh... uuuuhhhhh I can explain. So you know that the holidays are coming up and all of that. Well overwatch released their christmas holiday on Overwatch. People are already going crazy on the ships already, well here comes more. Everyone was freaking out about Witch Mercy but oh boy do we have more costumes like that. <br>
        We have the baiting Widowmaker emote with the mistletoe highlight intro, but victory poses of other characters with mistletoes. Oh right, you want me to explain why my nose was bleeding. Well the holiday skins... are... uhhhhhhhh... how the hell am I goind to describe this, okay. Fine they are really bae! <br>
        There happy that I said it now!? No idea why but Pharah's and Sombra's holiday costumes are just so cool. Wait hold on you Tracer and Mei fanatics who think because they have legendary skins they are better, my reasoning is perfectly explainable and it is because of their color schemes. I just love the designs on them and since I guess both are my baes... I like there's the most? I dunno, just they look really good in my opinion. So I guess that explains my nose bleed.
        <p>12/8/16: The new set for MTG just got some cards spoiled, and all of the planeswalkers haven't been seen in years. I knew atleast one of the planeswalkers in this new set would be <a href="http://crystal-cdn2.crystalcommerce.com/photos/1141753/large/ajani.jpg" id="interaction"> Ajani (set he was last featured in).</a> However, I was never prepared to find out what the other planeswalkers would be. Both of these planeswalkers haven't been seen as a card for years.
        One of them is <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=214065&type=card" id="interaction">Tezzeret.</a>The last time we saw him was in the mirrodin set, which was released over half a decade ago. Even though he was released once again in modern masters/enternal masters, it didn't really follow along the storyline. Tezzeret has returned in Kaladesh and plans to use his resurrected body to kill Jace. This leaves us off to the final planeswalker, the one who resurrected him. He was last featured in Magic Core 2013. Similar to Ugin, he is a dragon named <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=179441&type=card" id="interaction">Nicol Bolas.</a> Because of these planeswalkers, the block is about to grow very chaotic.</p>
        <p>12/5: So Mean Streets of Gadgetzan came out. To say the least, the whole entire meta of the game has changed, but in a good way. The midrange shaman decks have some competition with other cards, the new archetypes have replaced a lot of the Whispers of the old gods cards, but not too much to the point where the game would be ruined, and it seems as if handlock has finally made it's return.
        For some who do not know, handlock (which is a warlock focusing on the amount of cards in hand other than minions) is by far my favorite type of deck in hearthstone. I liked it so much that I tried creating a really good handlock deck before the newest expansion pack. The type of handlock is around <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTx2OzKy1-HH1vGllRHB0j4BkEdYj4rBzeNmzi5bvE6zCYPGk9i2w" id="interaction"> Reno Jackson.</a>
        Renolock has increasingly became competitive once more as well as mountain giant making handlock once again... an amazing and thought-provoking deck. With other cards like <a href="http://media.esportsedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Kazakus.jpg" id="interaction">Kazakus</a> just made it even stronger.
        This is possibly one of my favorite decks and once I get him, I will be making it. However, my favorite deck so far is Jade Druid. My Jade Druid deck consists of multiple spells and high costing creatures that can either tip the scales into my favor, or just suprise the enemy with gigantic jade golems and mana ramping.
        This is possibly one of the best sets to date.</p>
        <p>11/29: I have finally decided the edits I am going to make on my character. The edits are going to make the character more detailed and more interesting to what I want. I may also make new OCs (THAT ARE NOT FURRIES) just so I can use multiple characters when necessary other than my friend's OC cause I don't think I want a hedgehog and a MLP rip off to be my only options >;).</p>
        <p>11/28:Change in OC design in order to create more details. Shading may be included for extra practice. I think I maybe a furry just because of one friend (THANKS!!!! DUSTIN!!!!!) sending me a certain comic. BUT SCREW IT!!!! I AINT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DRESS UP LIKE THEM AND GO TO THE CONVENTIONS!!!!!</p>
        <p>11/18: Going to finally record the audio part for my friend's new series. Not sure when the noose (I mean news) will be ready.</p>
        <p>11/14:I will be a guest in a friend's news series. If you want to check his channel out and/or the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlZdXb7jXN0" id="interaction">CLICK HERE!</a></p><br/>
        <p>In other news(involving gaming) I have wasted 5$ to get two CARDS!!!!! These two cards however are actually really broken cards in the card game: Hearthstone! Both are 6 mana legendaries and their names
        are: <a href="http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/147/825/33.png" id="interaction">Sylvanas Windrunner</a> and <a href="https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/thumb/1/18/Cairne_Bloodhoof(498)_Gold.png/184px-Cairne_Bloodhoof(498)_Gold.png?version=d6f616dac638cd886ae55690001324f2" id="interaction">
        Cairne Bloodhoof!</a> So far, I have not yet lost one battle with my new <a href="http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/289/222/33134.png" id="interaction">N'zoth</a> deck and I can't wait to use it later on.</p>
