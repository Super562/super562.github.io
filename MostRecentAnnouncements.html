        <p>12/5: So Mean Streets of Gadgetzan came out. To say the least, the whole entire meta of the game has changed, but in a good way. The midrange shaman decks have some competition with other cards, the new archetypes have replaced a lot of the Whispers of the old gods cards, but not too much to the point where the game would be ruined, and it seems as if handlock has finally made it's return.
        For some who do not know, handlock (which is a warlock focusing on the amount of cards in hand other than minions) is by far my favorite type of deck in hearthstone. I liked it so much that I tried creating a really good handlock deck before the newest expansion pack. The type of handlock is around <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTx2OzKy1-HH1vGllRHB0j4BkEdYj4rBzeNmzi5bvE6zCYPGk9i2w" id="interaction"> Reno Jackson.</a>
        Renolock has increasingly became competitive once more as well as mountain giant making handlock once again... an amazing and thought-provoking deck. With other cards like <a href="http://media.esportsedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Kazakus.jpg" id="interaction">Kazakus</a> just made it even stronger.
        This is possibly one of my favorite decks and once I get him, I will be making it. However, my favorite deck so far is Jade Druid. My Jade Druid deck consists of multiple spells and high costing creatures that can either tip the scales into my favor, or just suprise the enemy with gigantic jade golems and mana ramping.
        This is possibly one of the best sets to date.</p>
        <p>11/29: I have finally decided the edits I am going to make on my character. The edits are going to make the character more detailed and more interesting to what I want. I may also make new OCs (THAT ARE NOT FURRIES) just so I can use multiple characters when necessary other than my friend's OC cause I don't think I want a hedgehog and a MLP rip off to be my only options >;).</p>
        <p>11/28:Change in OC design in order to create more details. Shading may be included for extra practice. I think I maybe a furry just because of one friend (THANKS!!!! DUSTIN!!!!!) sending me a certain comic. BUT SCREW IT!!!! I AINT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DRESS UP LIKE THEM AND GO TO THE CONVENTIONS!!!!!</p>
        <p>11/18: Going to finally record the audio part for my friend's new series. Not sure when the noose (I mean news) will be ready.</p>
        <p>11/14:I will be a guest in a friend's news series. If you want to check his channel out and/or the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlZdXb7jXN0" id="interaction">CLICK HERE!</a></p><br/>
        <p>In other news(involving gaming) I have wasted 5$ to get two CARDS!!!!! These two cards however are actually really broken cards in the card game: Hearthstone! Both are 6 mana legendaries and their names
        are: <a href="http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/147/825/33.png" id="interaction">Sylvanas Windrunner</a> and <a href="https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/thumb/1/18/Cairne_Bloodhoof(498)_Gold.png/184px-Cairne_Bloodhoof(498)_Gold.png?version=d6f616dac638cd886ae55690001324f2" id="interaction">
        Cairne Bloodhoof!</a> So far, I have not yet lost one battle with my new <a href="http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/289/222/33134.png" id="interaction">N'zoth</a> deck and I can't wait to use it later on.</p>
