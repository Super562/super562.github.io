      <p> I don't know what I would say about me in a nutshell... oh wait, I DO!!!! Now only if I could make a song out of it, danget. Anyways, I am a crazy loser who spends his time on the internet for most of his free time. I also watch anime and play a lot of video games. <br><br>
        Wow, that was short, I could also include that I draw on my deviantart page, but no one cares about that crap right? Well I guess I should describe most of my highlights within my life... ALSO IN A NUTSHELL!!!!! <br> <br>
          I was in a KYR SP33DY video called "You Sound Like KYR SP33DY" Which I came across a couple of months after its initial release. I panicked and I enjoyed it. What else could I say? I guess nothing else. I don't wanna get too personal so I don't think I will say anymore. <br> <br>
          Jeez, you know you have no life when your only non personal achievement is when you were in a KYR SP33DY video which is really sad. So ya! R.I.P.
