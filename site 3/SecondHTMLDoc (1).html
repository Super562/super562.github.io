<h1>Super's Website</h1>
<p>Oh hello there, I didn't see you. Welcome to the website. I am professor Poopy Bott- OKAY, WHY IS THIS IN MY SCRIPT! Name is actually Super562, and I have no idea why that name was in my document, I blame my friend Isaac! I love to play video games and sometimes draw random things. I used to play soccer but I slowly became handicapped and lost interest. </p>

<p>Anyways, this is the first time I am trying an HTML site. As a person who is interested in coding, this is pretty simple yet cool. Then again, I am using Adobe Dreamweaver. Anyways, I personally like doing this typing random things on here. So yeah, I think that is about it.</p>
<p> <strong>NOW YOU GOTTA JUST DO THE SPUNGE!!!!</strong></p>
